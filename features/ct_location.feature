Feature: Location Landing Page Content type
  As an anonymous user,
  I want to visit an location page in order to learn more information about the
  many locations, and how I might contact them.

  Scenario: Verify that the location content type has the correct fields
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    And "location_icon" terms:
      | name                    | field_sprite_name |
      | Behat: Transit Friendly | transit           |
    Then the content type "location" has the fields:
      | field                          | tag        | type      | multivalue |
      | field-accessibility            | textarea   |           | false      |
